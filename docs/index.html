<b><h1>Feature list</h1></b>
<br>
<ul>
	<b><h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/docs/screenshots/WhoWhatWhere.png">Who What Where</a></h2></b> <li>See the IP addresses that your computer communicates with, sorted by amount of packets transmitted. Shows GeoIP and a ping result for each address. Can be used for determining a game server IP or monitoring suspicious internet connections.</li>
	<br>
	<b><h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/docs/screenshots/PingToSpeech.png">Ping to Speech</a></h2></b><li>Press a hotkey and hear the result of a ping sent to a predefined IP address or hostname. Useful while playing online games.</li>
	<br>
	<b><h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/docs/screenshots/Watchdog.png">Watchdog</a></h2></b><li>Inspects network traffic and waits for a packet from a predefined list of IP addresses and source/destination ports and several protocols. Upon finding a match, a predefined message will be read out by text-to-speech. This feature can be used as a notifier for an incoming connection, for example.</li>
	<br>
	<b><h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/docs/screenshots/VisualTrace.png">Trace and Visual Trace</a></h2></b><li>Perform a trace-route for a given IP address or hostname. Once the trace is complete, a visual trace is available, which shows the route of your packet on a map.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b><h1>Installating and Running</h1></b>
<br>
<b><h2>Prerequisites</h2></b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li><h3>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8_60 or newer</h3>
	<a href="http://java.com/en/">Download JRE here</a>. If you already have JRE installed and want to check the version, open the command line (cmd) and type "java -version".</li>
	<li><h3>WinPcap</h3><a href="http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm">Download WinPcap here</a>. WinPcap is a program that allows capturing network packets on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><h2>Running the program</h2></b>
<br>
Once you've installed Java and WinPcap, download WhoWhatWhere and extract the archive. Run the executable and allow ~10 seconds to load. This program requires administator rights in order to capture network packets. If you're prompted by Windows, allow it access.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b><h2>How to Use</h2></b>
<br>
Who What Where can be minimized to the systrem tray by pressing the 'x' (close window) button. In order to exit for the program, press the Exit button or use the menu bar "File".
<br>
<b><h3>Pick your netowrk adapter: </h3></b> In the top-left pane there should be a list with at least one network adapter (<a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/docs/screenshots/NetworkAdapter.png">example</a>). Select the adapter your want to listen to. If you're not sure which one to choose (the name would often have "ethernet" or "wireless" in it), just try and see which one works.
<br>
<b><h3>Who What Where</h3></b>
Who What Where listens to your internet traffic and shows you which IP addresses were contacted, as well as some additional info such as ping time and geographical location of the IP address.
<br>
<a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/docs/screenshots/CaptureOptions.png">Capture Options</a>
<ul>
	<li>Protocol selection: If no protocol is selected, then all protocols will be counted. Otherwise, only packets of the selected protocols will be counted.</li>
	<li>Automatically/manually stop capture: Choose if you'd like to stop the capture yourself, or let it stop automatically after a certain amount of time.</li>
	<li>Capture options:
	<br>
		<i>Get location info for each IP address</i> - If checked, every IP address entry will also show its geographical location information (see limitations). If unchecked, the results will be displayed a bit quicker.
		<br>
		<i>Ping each IP address</i> - If checked, each IP address entry will also show the ping result to that IP. There is also a configurable timeout. If unchecked, the results will be displayed a bit quicker.
	</li>
</ul>

<a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/docs/screenshots/HotkeyOptions.png">Hotkey and Text-To-Speech Options</a>
Instead of manually pressing the start/stop buttons, you can use a hotkey. The hotkey is active globally, meaning you can press it while using any other application and even when Who What Where is minimized to the system tray.
<br>
When the hotkey is used, the text-to-speech feature can be enabled which then reads out the results to you, so you don't have the look at the application screen. This is useful when you already know what you're looking for. 
<br>
You can also filter out what is read to you, the first X rows or only rows that contain a certain value in a certain column. You can also select which column values to read out.
