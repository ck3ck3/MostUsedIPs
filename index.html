		<p><strong>A suite of diagnostic tools for network monitoring. See which IP addresses your computer communicates with and where they're from, use a hotkey to have ping results read out to you, visually trace the route of your packets, and use the Watchdog to get notified in real-time when network packets match rules that you've defined.</strong></p>

				<p>See the IP addresses that your computer communicates with, sorted by amount of packets transmitted. Shows GeoIP information (organization, country, region, and city) and a ping result for each address. Examples where this might be useful are monitoring suspicious internet connections and determining a game server's IP.</p>
				<p>Click "Start monitoring" to let Who What Where monitor your network traffic. When monitoring stops (manually by pressing the button or using the hotkey, or when a pre-defined timer expires) the table will get populated with the IP addresses that your computer communicated with during the monitoring, along with some useful statistics. When you use the hotkey to start or stop monitoring you can optionally have the results read out to you, so that you don't need to have Who What Where visible on your screen.</p>
				<b>Monitoring Settings</b>
				<ul>
				  <li><p>Automatically stop monitoring: If enabled, monitoring will stop automatically after a certain amount of time. If disabled, monitoring will stop when the user clicks the "Stop monitoring" button (or uses the hotkey).</p></li>
				  <li><p>Get location info for each IP address - If checked, every IP address entry will also show its owning organization name and geographical location information (see <a href="#GeoIPLimitations">limitations</a>). If unchecked, the results will be displayed a bit quicker.</p></li>

					<li><p>Ping each IP address - If checked, each IP address entry will also show the ping result to that IP. The pings are performed after monitoring is stopped and the results get updated in the table as they arrive.</p></li>
				  
				  <li><p>Protocol selection: If no protocol is selected, then all protocols will be counted. Otherwise, only packets of the selected protocols will be counted.</p></li>
				</ul>

				<b>Hotkey and Text To Speech Settings</b>
				<p>Instead of manually pressing the start/stop buttons, you can use a hotkey. The hotkey is active globally, meaning
				you can press it while using any other application and even when Who What Where is minimized to the system tray. If a monitoring session is currently in progress, the hotkey will stop it. Otherwise, it will start a new monitoring session. If the text to speech feature is enabled and
				the hotkey is used to start or stop monitoring, the results will be read out to you - so that you don't have the look at the application screen. This is useful when you already know what you're looking for. You can also filter out what is read to you,
				the first X rows or only rows that contain a certain value in a certain column. You can also select which column values to read out.
				</p>
				
				<b>Other features</b>
				<p>Right-clicking on a result in the table opens a pop-up menu with several options, including "See more GeoIP results for this IP in the browser" which loads a GeoIP service
				results in the default web-browser. This site might have more (or different) results than what's shown in the table. See <a href="#GeoIPLimitations">GeoIP Limitations</a>.
				<br><br>
				<a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/IPNotes.png">IP notes:</a> Allows you to associate notes with IP addresses. Either add a note from the results table by clicking the IP notes cell on a row, or manage all of the IP notes from the menu "File" -> "Manage IP notes". 
				<br>IP notes can help remember what's the IP address used for, and can also be used in a rule in Watchdog.

				<a href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/QuickPing.png"><img class="image-teaser" src="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/QuickPing.png"></a>
				<p>Press a hotkey and hear the result of a ping sent to a predefined IP address or hostname. Useful while playing online games. The ping result can be shown in a pop-up message or read out loud in one of several voices and languages (English, French, German, Italian).</p>
				<h3>How to use:</h3>
				<p>Enter any IP or hostname, and press the hotkey. The ping result will be read out or shown in a pop-up message. If you choose to have the result read out loud, you can select from several voices and languages (English, German, French, Italian) through the menu "Options" -> "Configure text to speech voice". The hotkey is configurable, and the default one (Ctrl+NumPad 0) requires the numlock on your keyboard to be on.

			<div id="tabs-visualTrace">
				<a href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/VisualTraceAnim.gif"><img class="image-teaser" src="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/VisualTraceAnim.gif"></a>
				<p>Perform a traceroute for a given IP address or hostname and see the route plotted on a map as the trace progresses.</p>
				<h3>How to use:</h3>
				<p>Enter any IP or hostname, and set the settings to your preferred values.
				<ul>
					<li>Ping timeout sets the timeout for each of the 3 pings that are perfromed per hop.</li>
					<li>Checking the "Resolve hostnames" checkbox will try to get the hostname of each hop, keep in mind this might slow the trace down. </li>
					<li>The setting "Stop tracing if X consecutive hops haven't responded" allows you to automatically stop the trace once it's not likely that another hop will be discovered, instead of waiting for the trace to end by reaching its maximum of 30 hops.</li>
				</ul>
				Once you're ready, click "Trace" to start, and watch the route get plotted as the trace advances. When the trace ends (either by reaching the destination hop or due to the user aborting the trace) you can show/hide any map pin on the route by the checking/unchecking the checkbox on the trace results table. You can also click the magnifying glass icon ("Zoom in") to see the exact location of the hop and zoom further in with the spinner's arrows.
				<br>By right clicking any row in the table you can see more GeoIP Info from another GeoIP source on your default browser.

			<div id="tabs-watchdog">
				<a href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/Watchdog.png"><img class="image-teaser" src="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/Watchdog.png"></a>
				<p>Inspects network traffic and checks if any packet matches a predefined filter. Filters include IP address or ranges (subnets), packet direction (incoming/outgoing), protocol, source/destination ports, and packet size. Upon finding a match, a predefined message will be displayed in a pop-up message or read out loud in one of several voices and languages (English, French, German, Italian).
				<br>This feature can be used as a notifier for an incoming connection, for example.
				</p>
				<h3>How to use:</h3>
				<p>Watchdog listens to your network traffic and informs you when a packet matches a certain rule that you set. You can set rules based on IP address or ranges (subnets), IP notes, packet direction (incoming/outgoing), protocol, source/destination ports and packet size.
				<br>When a match is found, the message you wrote for that rule will be read out by text-to-speech (in a voice and language that you can configure) or displayed as a pop-up on the screen. 
				<br>Select a radiobutton to indicate if Watchdog should just wait for the first packet of this type and inform you, or keep watching for these packets until you stop it. If you choose to keep looking for matches, specify
				a cooldown period. A cooldown period is the minimal amount of time between getting Watchdog alerts; its purpose is to avoid flooding you with messages. Minimal cooldown period is 1 second, the default is 3 seconds.
				<br>Watchdog can be started by clicking the "Start Watchdog" button or pressing the hotkey. The default hotkey (Ctrl+NumPad Del) requires the numlock on your keyboard to be on.

		<h1>Case study</h1>
		<a href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/case-study.html">NBA 2K17 case study</a> - how Who What Where can help diagnose network-lag problems in a PC game, and how the Watchdog utility can inform us of a match that is about to start.

	    <h1>Installing and running</h1>

	    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        <h3>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8_60 or newer</h3>
	        <p><a href="http://java.com/en/">Download JRE here</a>. If you already have JRE installed and want to check the version, open the command line (cmd) and type "java -version".</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        <h3>WinPcap</h3><p><a href="http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm">Download WinPcap here</a>. WinPcap is a program that allows capturing network packets on Windows.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>


	    <h2>Running the program</h2> 
	    <p>Once you've installed Java and WinPcap, download WhoWhatWhere and extract the archive. Run the executable and allow ~10 seconds to load. This program requires administrator rights in order to capture network packets. If you're prompted by Windows,
	    allow it access.</p>



	    <h2>How to Use</h2> 
	    <p>Who What Where can be minimized to the systrem tray by pressing the 'x' (close window) button. In order to exit for the program, use the menu "File" -> "Exit" or right-click the icon in the system-tray and choose "Exit". You can also set Who What Where to exit when clicking on the close window button by unchecking the menu item "Options" -> "Minimize to system tray on close".</p>

	    <h3>Pick your network adapter: </h3>
		<p>If your PC has more than one active network adapter, a <a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/NicSelection.png">choice dialog</a> will be displayed on the first run of the program. You can use the "Auto-detect" button or choose your network adapter from a list. You can always get to this dialog manually if needed, by using the menu "Options" -> "Select network adapter".
		</p>
		
		<h3>Choose a text to speech voice and language</h3>
		<p>Use the menu "Options" -> "Configure text to speech voice" to <a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/VoiceSelection.png">choose a voice and language</a> for the various features. Who What Where can only use the English voices, but Quick Ping and Watchdog can also use German, French, and Italian voices. You can preview each voice by clicking on the "Preview" button, and you can also customize the preview text.
		</p>

	    <h3><i>Note about GeoIP Limitations:</i></h3> <p>Geographical IP services aren't always accurate. The address is based on what the company that owns the address reported when the address was bought. Sometimes an international company might list all their IPs are located in one area (where the main
	    offices are, for example), but some of these IPs may be used in other areas that the company operates. This is why sometimes for one IP address there may be more than one possible location, or an incorrect one.
