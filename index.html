	    <h1>Feature list</h1>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	      	<h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/WhoWhatWhere.png">Who What Where</a></h2>
	      	<p>See the IP addresses that your computer communicates with, sorted by amount of packets transmitted. Shows GeoIP and a ping result for each address. Can be used for determining a game server IP or monitoring suspicious internet connections.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li>
	      	<h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/PingToSpeech.png">Ping to Speech</a></h2>
	      	<p>Press a hotkey and hear the result of a ping sent to a predefined IP address or hostname. Useful while playing online games.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li>
	      	<h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/Watchdog.png">Watchdog</a></h2>
			<p>Inspects network traffic and checks if any packet matches a predefined filter. Filters include packet direction (incoming/outgoing), IP address or ranges (subnets), user notes, packet size (including ranges) and source/destination ports ranges. Upon finding a match, a predefined message will be read out by text-to-speech or displayed in a pop-up message.
			<br>This feature can be used as a notifier for an incoming connection, for example.
			</p>
	      </li>

	      <li>
	      	<h2><a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/VisualTrace.png">Visual Trace</a></h2>
	      	<p>Perform a trace-route for a given IP address or hostname. Once the trace is complete, a visual trace is available, which shows the route of your packet on a map.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
		
		<h1>Case study</h1>
		<a href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/case-study.html">NBA 2K17 case study</a> - how Who What Where can help diagnose network-lag problems in a PC game, and how the Watchdog utility can inform us of a match that is about to start.

	    <h1>Installing and running</h1>

	    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        <h3>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8_60 or newer</h3>
	        <p><a href="http://java.com/en/">Download JRE here</a>. If you already have JRE installed and want to check the version, open the command line (cmd) and type "java -version".</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        <h3>WinPcap</h3><p><a href="http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm">Download WinPcap here</a>. WinPcap is a program that allows capturing network packets on Windows.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>


	    <h2>Running the program</h2> 
	    <p>Once you've installed Java and WinPcap, download WhoWhatWhere and extract the archive. Run the executable and allow ~10 seconds to load. This program requires administrator rights in order to capture network packets. If you're prompted by Windows,
	    allow it access.</p>



	    <h2>How to Use</h2> 
	    <p>Who What Where can be minimized to the systrem tray by pressing the 'x' (close window) button. In order to exit for the program, press the Exit button or right-click the icon in the system-tray and choose "Exit".</p>

	    <h3>Pick your network adapter: </h3> 
	    <p>In the top-left pane there should be a list with at least one network adapter (<a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/NetworkAdapter.png">example</a>). Select the adapter your want to listen to. If you're not
	    sure which one to choose (the name would often have "ethernet" or "wireless" in it), just try and see which one works.</p>

	    <h3>Who What Where</h3> 
	    <p>Who What Where listens to (aka "captures") your internet traffic and shows you which IP addresses were contacted, as well as some additional info such as ping time and geographical location of the IP address. Set your preferred settings, start and
	    stop a capture - and the results will be shown in the table.
		<br><br>
	    <a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/CaptureOptions.png">Capture Options:</a>
	    <ul>
	      <li><p>Protocol selection: If no protocol is selected, then all protocols will be counted. Otherwise, only packets of the selected protocols will be counted.</p></li>
	      <li><p>Automatically/manually stop capture: Choose if you'd like to stop the capture yourself, or let it stop automatically after a certain amount of time.</p></li>
	      <li><p>Extra information:

	        <br><i>Get location info for each IP address</i> - If checked, every IP address entry will also show its geographical location information (see <a href="#GeoIPLimitations">limitations</a>). If unchecked, the results will be displayed a bit quicker.

	        <br><i>Ping each IP address</i> - If checked, each IP address entry will also show the ping result to that IP. There is also a configurable timeout. If unchecked, the results will be displayed a bit quicker.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/TableRightClick.png">Right-clicking on a result in the table opens a pop-up menu</a> with several options: "See more GeoIP results in the browser" loads a GeoIP service
	    results in the default web-browser. This site might have more (or different) results than what's shown in the table. See <a href="#GeoIPLimitations">GeoIP Limitations</a>.
		<br><br>
		<a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/UserNotesWWW.png">User notes:</a> Allows users to associate notes with IP addresses. Either add a note from the results table by clicking the user notes cell on a row, or manage all of the user notes from the menu "File" -> "Manage user notes". 
		<br>User notes can help remember what's the IP address used for, and can also be used as a filter in Watchdog.
		<br><br>
	    <a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/HotkeyOptions.png">Hotkey and Text-To-Speech Options:</a> Instead of manually pressing the start/stop buttons, you can use a hotkey. The hotkey is active globally, meaning
	    you can press it while using any other application and even when Who What Where is minimized to the system tray. If a capture is running, the hotkey will stop it. Otherwise, it will start a new capture. If the text-to-speech feature is enabled and
	    you use the hotkey to start or stop the capture, the results will be read out ot you - so you don't have the look at the application screen. This is useful when you already know what you're looking for. You can also filter out what is read to you,
	    the first X rows or only rows that contain a certain value in a certain column. You can also select which column values to read out.
		</p>

	    <h3>Ping to Speech</h3> <p>Put in any IP or hostname, and press the hotkey. The ping result will be read out. The hotkey is configurable, and the default one (Ctrl+NumPad 0) requires the numlock on your keyboard to be on.


	    <h3>Watchdog</h3> <p>Watchdog listens to your network traffic and informs you when a packet matches a certain filter that you set. You can set filters based on packet direction (incoming/outgoing), IP address or ranges (subnets), user notes, packet size (including ranges) and source/destination ports ranges.
		<br>Click "Manage match list" to add entries to the filters list, or load a saved preset. When a match is found, the message you wrote for that filter will be read out by text-to-speech or displayed as a pop-up on the screen, according to your selection. Once the filters and messages are set, press Done.
		<br>Select a radiobutton to indicate if Watchdog should just wait for the first packet of this type and inform you, or keep watching for these packets until you stop it. If you choose to keep looking for matches, specify
		a cooldown period. A cooldown period is the minimal amount of time between getting a Watchdog alert, its purpose is to avoid flooding you with messages. Minimal cooldown period is 3 seconds.
		<br>To start the Watchdog, click "Start waiting for match" or press the hotkey. The default hotkey (Ctrl+NumPad 1) requires the numlock on your keyboard to be on.
		</p>
	    <h3>Visual Trace</h3> <p>Put in any IP or hostname, and click "Trace". A trace window opens, where you can configure a ping timeout and whether or not to resolve hostnames. Click "Start trace" and wait for the trace to <a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/Trace.png">complete</a>.
	    Then click "Show visual trace". In the <a class="imgLink" href="http://ck3ck3.github.io/WhoWhatWhere/screenshots/VisualTrace.png">Visual Trace screen</a> you can check/uncheck any hop on the route and see the changes on the map. You can also
	    click "Focus map here" to see the exact location of the hop zoomed in, or you can click "GeoIP Info" to view info from another GeoIP source on your default browser.

	    <h3><i>Note about GeoIP Limitations:</i></h3> <p>Geographical IP services aren't always accurate. The address is based on what the company that owns the address reported when the address was bought. Sometimes an international company might list all their IPs are located in one area (where the main
	    offices are, for example), but some of these IPs may be used in other areas that the company operates. This is why sometimes for one IP address there may be more than one possible location, or an incorrect one.
